Agile Development â€“ Advantages, Disadvantages and when to use it?

Here are my thoughts on the article:
Agile development is a concept that allows the completion of projects through the completion of short deliverables.
Lots of companies are using this method to deliver projects.
However there are some advantages and disadvantages to using agile development
Advantages are the following:
Rapid delivery of small improvements, but constant delivery of the small improvements.
Less time wasted on developments of projects that become obsolete before the final development
Integrates differents groups within a business, not only IT or not only Busines people. They work together instead of in silos.
Disadvantages are the following:
moves very quickly, therefore often lack of documentation as support
Does everyone understand eachothers needs?
when should it be used?
to makes changes in short periods of time
lower costs to make the changes

At my current job, we use agile mehtod to complete development projects for different business lines.
The method works well in practice to complete tasks and deliverables in short periods of time. 
However often the deliverables feel cheap and low impact to the entity.
Often the project overall project seems incomplete
I feel its important to have a balance between too short deliverables and deliverables that are to long, this will ensure that the delierables respect a certain level of quality.
These are just my thoughts based on what I have experienced in real life projects.
