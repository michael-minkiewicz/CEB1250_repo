Here are my thoughts on the article:

Props to Sabrina Marchand for finding this article.
This article is cool because it covers material we saw in class this past week therefore great to strengthen my understanding.

The article covers the CAP theorem on how a trade off must be made for distributed database systems only 2 of the following can be achieved: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance.

The article breaks down the elements of the Theorem with cool visual examples to undertstand each condition.
Partition Tolerance: network can sustain failure but will not affect the entire network (ie: 1 node failure, the system will continue to operate)
Consistency: when a transaction is started it is completed, if inconsistent, the whole transaction is rolled back.
Availability: System is always operational, if 2 transactions are submitted at the sametime we dont know which one will be the output.

To conclude in an ideal world one would want Availability, Consistency, & Partition Tolerance, however that does not exist in real life.
Therefore need to have a tradeoff based on what the clients 2 most important needs are out of Availability, Consistency, & Partition Tolerance.
This article is a great recap on the material we saw this week.
