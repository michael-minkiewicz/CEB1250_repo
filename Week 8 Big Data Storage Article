See the link below to my big data storage article for this week:
https://blogs.perficient.com/2016/07/15/most-common-nosql-databases/

Here are my thoughts on the article:

The article breaksdown the 4 most common types of NoSQL databases, therefore making the link with concepts we have learned in class.
What was cool about the article was it briefly broke down key based, column based, document based & graph based databases.
It gave options for databases depending on the type of NoSQL ie: Cassandra, HBase for column; neo4j for graph; couchDB for document; & redis oracle for Key.
The article also gives a breakdown of how the values or nodes are stored and the format they must respect.
This was a great summary of the NoSQL concepts we learned and class.
Also this article is a good reference when I want to make a quick decision on what type of format I want my database to have.
