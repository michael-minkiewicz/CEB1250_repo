See the link below to the article I found:

Here are my thoughts on the article:
Every week I try and find an article that is linked to the material you thought us in class. 
I know the article is a bit dated, but it breaks down very nicely the difference between ACID vs BASE Data properties.
ACID
I like the example the article gives about purchasing an item online and not having to lockdown the database to process the transaction. 
Or listing the amount of items in inventory on an ecommerce website, the article explains that the information provided is probably delayed (cached data).
BASE
The article also explains base and how it is applied in accounting software where they close the month with accruals (estimations), and the rest of the data comes in later.
What was also interesting is the article said that you can violate different properties of ACID and BASE, therefore I guess these are more guidelines than anything else.
